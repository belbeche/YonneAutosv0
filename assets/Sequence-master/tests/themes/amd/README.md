## Getting Started

1. Move the `test-theme` directory to the same directory as the page you'd like the theme to appear on.
2. Add the stylesheet within the `<head></head>` tags on your page below existing stylesheets, using the following:
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="test-theme/css/sequence-theme.test-theme.css" />`
3. From index.html in the downloaded theme, copy everything inside the <body></body> tags, then paste into the page you'd like the theme to appear on.
4. Add a reference to the Sequence library, its third-party dependencies, and the theme options just before the closing `</body>` element on your page:
```javascript
<script src="scripts/third-party/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/third-party/hammer.min.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/sequence.min.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/sequence-theme.test-theme.js"></script>
```
5. From index.html in the downloaded theme, copy everything inside the <body></body> tags, then paste into the page you'd like the theme to appear on.
6. Save your file and upload newly added/modified files to your web server. You're done!

A theme's options can be changed in `scripts/sequence-theme.test-theme.js`. See Options in the [documentation](http://www.sequencejs.com/developers/documentation/).
